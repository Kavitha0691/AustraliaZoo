      "Echidnas are spiny, egg-laying mammals with hollow quills, found throughout Australia.",
    bigDescription: `Echidnas are fascinating monotremes that lay eggs rather than giving birth to live young. They have spiny fur, and use their long sticky tongue to catch ants and termites. Echidnas are found throughout Australia and New Guinea in various habitats. Despite their spiky appearance, they are shy and solitary animals that use their powerful claws to dig for food and create burrows. Echidnas have a low body temperature compared to other mammals and possess electroreceptors in their snouts to help detect prey underground.`,
